# Scrivener

Acts as a helper between XMPP and HipChat so that when an XMPP client mentions a user's name, that mention is converted to a HipChat-style "mention" so that the user being mentioned is actually notified.

This shouldn't be necessary. If you find this bot as annoying as I do, please [vote for HipChat to fix their XMPP support](http://help.hipchat.com/forums/138883-suggestions/suggestions/2979786-xmpp-group-chat-nicknames).
